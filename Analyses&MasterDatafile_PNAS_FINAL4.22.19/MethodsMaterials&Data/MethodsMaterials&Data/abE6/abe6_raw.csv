However, there are a number of difficult problems in programming self-driving cars. For instance, cars in heavy traffic face significant danger at yellow traffic lights. The director of software engineering at a company developing self-driving cars wants to reduce accidents at yellow lights, and he thinks of a way to do this. He decides that in order to reduce rear-end collisions in heavy traffic, all of the company’s cars will be programmed to accelerate whenever they are close to a stoplight as it turns yellow.

However, there are a number of difficult problems in programming self-driving cars. For instance, cars in heavy traffic face significant danger at yellow traffic lights. The director of software engineering at a company developing self-driving cars wants to reduce accidents at yellow lights, and he thinks of two ways to do this. So, he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning cars to be programmed in one of two ways. Half of the company’s cars will be programmed to brake whenever they are close to a stoplight as it turns yellow, in order to reduce side-impact collisions in heavy traffic. The other cars will be programmed to accelerate whenever they are close to a stoplight as it turns yellow, in order to reduce rear-end collisions in heavy traffic.
