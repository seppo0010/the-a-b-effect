These treatments can save lives, but they can also lead to deadly infections. A hospital director comes up with an idea to reduce these infections. He decides to give each doctor who performs this procedure a new ID badge with a list of standard safety precautions for the procedure printed on the back. All doctors performing this procedure will then have this list attached to their clothing, so they can look at it while performing the procedure. The director thinks that these new badges might help doctors remember all of the safety steps they were trained to take during the procedure.
