The body that accredits U.S. hospital residency programs has already determined that first-year residents must work no more than 80 hours per week, averaged over 4 weeks. Now it must decide, within that constraint, how long first-year residents may work in any one shift. Second-year and later residents may work up to 24 hours at a time. The accrediting body is concerned that residents working longer hours might get less sleep and that sleep-deprived residents might make errors that hurt patients. The accrediting body wants to adopt the policy that will best protect patients, so it decides that first-year residents at all hospitals it accredits may work no more than 16 hours at a time.

Colonoscopies can save lives by detecting colon cancer early, but they are not fun and many people avoid them. The CEO of a health system would like to increase patients’ likelihood of having a potentially life-saving colonoscopy, so he decides to send every patient a birthday card on their 50th birthday, which reads “It’s your 50th birthday – treat yourself to a colonoscopy!” The card will come with coupons for a bowel cleanser that patients need to drink before a colonoscopy, and a book of crossword puzzles to entertain them while they’re on the toilet. The idea is that this little bit of whimsy might make the procedure seem less “icky” and lead more patients to get colonoscopies.

Doctors know that both too little and too much oxygen can hurt these babies. They know that oxygen levels below 85% are too low, and they know that oxygen levels above 95% are too high. However, doctors do not know what level is best between 85% and 95%. The head of a hospital unit that cares for premature babies wants to give the babies the best chance of survival possible, so he decides to set all of the machines in his unit to keep these babies’ oxygen levels between 85% and 89%.

The accrediting body is concerned that shorter work hours mean more patient hand-offs, which are dangerous because it is easy for important patient information not to be relayed between care teams. Shorter hours might also mean less education, or socialization into a kind of “shift mentality” that reduces professionalism — either of which might result in less competent and less committed doctors for patients in the future. The accrediting body wants to adopt the policy that will best protect patients, so it decides that first-year residents at all hospitals it accredits may work no more than 24 hours at a time.
