My concern is if that information enters the public domain, either by hacking or by sale to others.  Could that information then be misused?  We have had to many breaches of major systems (Equifax, etc.).   Could someone be bombarded with unsolicited emails / phishing / spam because the hacked / sold information indicates someone has a medical condition?
