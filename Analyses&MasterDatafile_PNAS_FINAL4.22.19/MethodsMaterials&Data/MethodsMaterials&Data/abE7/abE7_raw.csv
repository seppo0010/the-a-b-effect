However, there are a number of difficult problems in programming self-driving cars. For instance, cars in heavy traffic face significant danger at yellow traffic lights. The director of software engineering at a company developing self-driving cars wants to reduce accidents at yellow lights, and he thinks of a way to do this. He decides that in order to reduce collisions in heavy traffic, all of the company’s cars will be programmed to match the accelerating or braking behavior of nearby cars when they are close to a traffic light as it turns yellow.

The system is set up to only allow customers to contact people who are recommended as a match. The CEO of the dating service wants to improve customer satisfaction by introducing a new way to match people together. He thinks of a way to do this. So, he decides to program his website to report users are a match when they are very similar to each other, based on the questions they answered.

How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","People sometimes get genetically tested to learn more about their ancestry. However, genetic testing can also reveal important health risks that people wouldn’t otherwise learn they have. The research director at a popular genetic testing company wants to help customers learn more about their health risks, but the company’s testing system only collects enough genetic material to run one health-related test. So, the research director decides that in addition to testing for ancestry, the company will also test customers for their risk of developing certain kinds of cancer later in life. Customers will have the option of viewing these results or not.

How appropriate is the director's decision?","Some genetic mutations lead to health conditions that can make a person sick, or even cause them to die. Many of these health conditions can be prevented or slowed by taking certain steps once a person knows they have the genetic mutation, but others cannot. A certain genetic testing company currently only returns “genealogy” results, about customers’ family tree and national origin, but the CEO wants to help as many people as he can. So, he decides that he will offer all of his clients the option to see if they have any genetic risks for health conditions that can be prevented or reduced. Customers will have the option of viewing these results or not.

How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","Many people like the idea of completely self-driving cars, which are capable of navigating the road without input from a human driver. These kinds of cars can make people’s lives easier and reduce accidents, but some of them prevent people from taking control of their car in the case of an emergency. The CEO of a company developing self-driving cars wants people to have as much freedom as possible on the road, while also remaining safe. So, he decides that all of the company’s cars will have a lever that allows drivers to switch between self-driving and human-driving modes.

How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","The founders of a new dating app are deciding how to suggest potential matches to its users. All users are able to view every other user’s profile and message him or her, but every day the app suggests to each user one new “match,” or person that he or she might like. The founders come up with a computer program for generating these matches. They decide that match suggestions will be based on the number of friends and friends-of-friends that users have in common on Facebook.
