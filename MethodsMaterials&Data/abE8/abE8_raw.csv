The system is set up to only allow customers to contact people who are recommended as a match. The CEO of the dating service wants to improve customer satisfaction by introducing a new way to match people together. He thinks of a way to do this. So, he decides to program his website to report users are a match when they are very similar to each other, based on the questions they answered.

The system is set up to only allow customers to contact people who are recommended as a match. The CEO of the dating service wants to improve customer satisfaction by introducing a new way to match people together. He thinks of two ways to do this.

For half of customers, his website will report users are a match when they are very similar to each other, based on the questions they answered. For the other half, his website will report users are a match when they are somewhat similar (but not TOO similar) to each other, based on the questions they answered.

 


How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","People sometimes get genetically tested to learn more about their ancestry. However, genetic testing can also reveal important health risks that people wouldn’t otherwise learn they have. The research director at a popular genetic testing company wants to help customers learn more about their health risks, but the company’s testing system only collects enough genetic material to run one health-related test. So, the research director decides that in addition to testing for ancestry, the company will also test customers for their risk of developing certain kinds of cancer later in life. All customers will have the option of viewing their result or not.

How appropriate is the director's decision?","Some genetic mutations lead to health conditions that can make a person sick, or even cause them to die. Many of these health conditions can be prevented or slowed by taking certain steps once a person knows they have the genetic mutation, but others cannot. A certain genetic testing company currently only returns “genealogy” results, about customers’ family tree and national origin, but the CEO wants to help as many people as he can. So, he decides that he will offer all of his clients the option to see if they have any genetic risks for health conditions that can be prevented or reduced. Customers will have the option of viewing these results or not.

How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","Many people like the idea of completely self-driving cars, which are capable of navigating the road without input from a human driver. These kinds of cars can make people’s lives easier and reduce accidents, but some of them prevent people from taking control of their car in the case of an emergency. The CEO of a company developing self-driving cars wants people to have as much freedom as possible on the road, while also remaining safe. So, he decides that all of the company’s cars will have a lever that allows drivers to switch between self-driving and human-driving modes.

If the information is provided solely to the person for their sole use and disclosure, then I find that use somewhat acceptable.  I would strongly advise that person to confirm this information with redundant testing from a qualified medical practitioner in which the testing meets medical standards.

My concern is if that information enters the public domain, either by hacking or by sale to others.  Could that information then be misused?  We have had to many breaches of major systems (Equifax, etc.).   Could someone be bombarded with unsolicited emails / phishing / spam because the hacked / sold information indicates someone has a medical condition?  Could a person be denied a financial transaction (e.g. loan), if the information indicates a high risk of an early death?  If a third party (e.g. lender) uses this information, are they required to disclose it?

On the one hand, I think people should generally be allowed unfettered access to information about themselves, including genetic conditions.On the other hand, people who opt to learn about genetic mutations, particularly those without treatment and possible devastating long-term prognoses, may be totally unprepared for the results they receive. The scenario, as described, doesn't really provide any path for assistance to those who may receive very bad news. I might also add that genetic testing is not foolproof, so I'd be very hesitant about allowing a company to send out missives that basically say, ""Here are your results. By the way, you have a fatal disease."" "
