Many of these health conditions can be prevented or slowed by taking certain steps once a person knows they have a genetic condition, but others cannot. A certain genetic testing company currently only returns ""genealogy"" results, about customers' family tree and national origins, but the CEO wants to help as many people as he can. So, he decides that he will offer all of his clients the option to see if they have any genetic risks for health conditions that can be prevented or reduced. Customers will have the option of viewing these results or not.

A certain genetic testing company currently only returns ""genealogy"" results, about customers' family tree and national origins, but the CEO wants to help as many people as he can.

He will offer half of his clients the option to see if they have any genetic risks for health conditions that can be prevented or reduced. He will offer the other half the option to see if they have any genetic risks for health conditions, whether or not these health conditions can be prevented or reduced.

These kinds of cars can make people's lives easier and reduce accidents, but some of them prevent people from taking control of their car in the case of emergency. The CEO of a company developing self-driving cars wants people to have as much freedom as possible while on the road, while also remaining safe. So, he decides that all of the company's cars will have a lever that allows drivers to switch between self-driving and human-driving modes.
