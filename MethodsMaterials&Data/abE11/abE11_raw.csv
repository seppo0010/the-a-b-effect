The body that accredits U.S. hospital residency programs has already determined that first-year residents must work no more than 80 hours per week, averaged over 4 weeks. Now it must decide, within that constraint, how long first-year residents may work in any one shift. Second-year and later residents may work up to 24 hours at a time. The accrediting body thinks of two different policies that could best protect patients, so it decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning hospitals to one of two test conditions. Residents at half of the hospitals the body accredits will be assigned to work no more than 16 hours at a time. The accrediting body is concerned that residents working longer hours might get less sleep and that sleep-deprived residents might make errors that hurt patients. Residents at the other half of the hospitals will be assigned to work no more than 24 hours at a time. The accrediting body is concerned that shorter work hours mean more patient hand-offs, which are dangerous because it is easy for important patient information not to be relayed between care teams. Shorter hours might also mean less education, or socialization into a kind of â€œshift mentalityâ€ù that reduces professionalism â€” either of which might result in less competent and less committed doctors for patients in the future. After a year, the accrediting body will require all hospitals it accredits to adopt whichever policy turns out to produce the best patient outcomes.    How appropriate is the accrediting body's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","Several drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for treating high blood pressure. Doctor Jones thinks of two different ways to provide good treatment to his patients, so decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning his patients who need high blood pressure medication to one of two test conditions. Half of patients will be prescribed drug A, and the other half will be prescribed drug B. Both drugs are affordable and patients can tolerate their side effects. After a year, he will only prescribe to new patients whichever drug has had the best outcomes for his patients.  How appropriate is Doctor Jones's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","In order to survive, babies born very prematurely need special machines that control how much oxygen is in their blood. Doctors know that both too little and too much oxygen can hurt these babies. They know that a saturation level below 85% is too low, and they know that a saturation level above 95% is too high. However, doctors do not know what level is best between 85% and 95%. The head of a hospital unit that cares for premature babies thinks of two different ways to give babies the best chance of survival, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning babies in his unit to one of two test conditions. Half of the babies will be treated by machines set to keep their oxygen levels between 85% and 89%. The other half will be treated by machines set to keep their oxygen levels between 91% and 95%. After a year, he will set all oxygen machines of the babies he treats to whichever range turns out to have the highest survival rate.  How appropriate is the hospital unit head's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","A state governmentâ€™s department of human services is tasked with distributing welfare and unemployment resources to struggling families. The head of this department thinks of two different ways to reduce poverty and unemployment, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning counties in his state to one of two test conditions. In half of counties, the state government will substantially increase welfare services offered to the poorest families: those who are the farthest below the poverty line. In the other half of counties, the state government will moderately increase welfare services equally to everyone below the poverty line. After a year, the state government will adopt for all counties in the state whichever policy turns out to best reduce poverty and unemployment.     How appropriate is the department head's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","Research has shown that increasing teacher happiness and well-being can result in better student outcomes. The superintendent of a school district thinks of two different ways to improve how well his elementary school students do, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning the schoolâ€™s teachers to one of two test conditions. Half of the schoolâ€™s teachers will receive a yearly bonus. The other half will receive additional vacation days during summer and winter breaks. After a year, the superintendent will give all teachers whichever benefit turns out to result in better student outcomes.           How appropriate is the superintendent's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","A poor nation with a severe shortage of nurses and doctors is creating a new civil service position: Health Assistant. These Health Assistants will undergo one year of training, then become the first line of healthcare for people living in the most remote regions of the country. The nationâ€™s congress thinks of two different ways to recruit the best people it can to become Health Assistants, so it decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning the nationâ€™s districts to one of two test conditions. For half of the districts, the congress will have recruitment posters made that emphasize the social benefits of becoming a Health Assistant, such as serving and being a leader in oneâ€™s community. For the other half, they will have recruitment posters made that emphasize the career benefits of becoming a Health Assistant, such as opportunities for promotion and professional development. After a year, the congress will have all districts in the nation use whichever kind of poster drew the highest-quality job applicants.    How appropriate is the congress's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","The American Cancer Society recommends that starting at age 50, healthy adults should get colonoscopies every 10 years. Colonoscopies can save lives by detecting colon cancer early, but they are not fun and many people avoid them. The medical director of a hospital thinks of two different ways to increase patientsâ€™ likelihood of having potentially life-saving colonoscopies, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning every patient to one of two test conditions. All patients will receive a birthday card on their 50th birthday, which reads â€œItâ€™s your 50th birthday - treat yourself to a colonoscopy!â€ù For half of patients, the card will come with coupons for a bowel cleanser that patients need to drink before a colonoscopy, and a book of crossword puzzles to entertain them while theyâ€™re on the toilet. The idea is that this little bit of whimsy might make the procedure seem less â€œickyâ€ù and lead more patients to have colonoscopies. For the other half of patients, the card will come with a notice of a pre-scheduled colonoscopy appointment, with options for selecting a more convenient time. Patients wonâ€™t be charged if they donâ€™t show up. The idea is that removing the chore of scheduling will lead more patients to have colonoscopies. After a year, the medical director will have all patients turning 50 receive whichever birthday package turns out to lead the most patients to have their recommended colonoscopies.      How appropriate is the medical director's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","Last year, a charity received a large number of donations. The director of this charity thinks of two different ways to help people in a low-income country escape extreme poverty, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning people to one of two test conditions. Half of all adults below a certain income level will receive a sturdy roof for their home. The other half will receive one month of training in a trade of their choice. After a year, the director will begin providing everyone in the country whichever resource (roof or training) turns out to help more people escape extreme poverty.       How appropriate is the director's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","The congress of a small country wants to provide support for citizens who are unable to find work, while also encouraging those citizens to find and take on jobs. The congress thinks of two different ways to do this, so it decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning citizens to one of two test conditions. Half of citizens who have been out of work for at least 12 months will receive the equivalent of $1000 per month for 6 months, or until they find a job, whichever comes first. The other half will receive the equivalent of $500 per month for 6 months, even if they find a job during that time. To be eligible for either of these payments, unemployed citizens must attend monthly job fairs run by the government. After a year, the congress will provide to all citizens who have been unemployed for at least 12 months whichever benefit system turns out to lead to lower unemployment among those who receive it. How appropriate is the congress's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","Most people in the U.S. save too little for retirement, causing them financial problems later in life. Company retirement plans are a good way to save, but too few employees choose to enroll in them. The CEO of a company thinks of two different ways to encourage newly hired employees to enroll in the company retirement savings plan, so he decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning new hires to one of two test conditions. For half of new hires, he will provide enrollment paperwork that highlights the most popular of the 10 investment funds the company offers. For the other half of new hires, he will increase the number of available investment funds from 10 to 15. After a year, the CEO will adopt whichever practice turns out to lead the most employees to enroll in the companyâ€™s retirement program.      How appropriate is the CEO's decision?","In a couple of sentences, please tell us why you chose the option you chose.","Several drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for treating high blood pressure.
